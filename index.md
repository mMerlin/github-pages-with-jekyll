# Welcome to my learning exploration

I hope you can find your way through the learning path I have taken, and documented part of here.  If I don't get lost myself, I will touch on a lot of topics here.

Robotics, programming languages, alternative energy, adative manufacturing, electronics, learning technigues, learning resources, technology, and more.  Hopefully organized for easy navigation.
